### Project Description

**Project Title: Excel Data Query and Conversion Tool**

**Description:**

This project involves creating a Python tool to convert Excel files into JSON format and provide a query interface for the resulting data. The tool uses the `openpyxl` library to read data from Excel spreadsheets and transform it into a structured JSON format for easy access and manipulation. 

Key features include:

1. **Excel to JSON Conversion**: The tool reads data from multiple worksheets in an Excel file, converts it into JSON format, and saves it to a file. This facilitates easier data handling and integration with other systems or applications.

2. **Dynamic Column Detection**: It automatically detects and extracts column headers from each worksheet, making it adaptable to different Excel file structures.

3. **Query Interface**: Provides a user-friendly query interface that allows users to search for specific values within the JSON data. The tool supports case-insensitive searches and prevents redundant results from being displayed.

4. **Output Handling**: The JSON data is saved to a file, and the query results are presented in a readable format, showing the matching rows and their details.

This project is useful for converting and querying Excel data efficiently, especially when dealing with large datasets or integrating Excel data into other applications.
